Problem Statement :
-----------------------

Create a simple version control program

What is it ?
--------------

Simple Version control is an easy to use version control program which keeps track 
of all the previous versions of a text file.File with latest version is opened for 
performing operations(appending/deleting) and on commiting creates a new version(new file).
Log file keeps track of each file and its version created.


NOTE - 
---------

On Entering the file name,its latest version will be opened.If the file does not exist a new file will be created.
To keep track of files we have created a log file which keeps track of all the versions.


Usage -
-----------

Language Used :: C
---------------

Input to the program includes the file name to be opened.Program is  menu driven which gives option for appending and deleting.

1) 'commit' -  Adds the changes in the current file abd creates a new version file.

2) 'undo changes' - Changes made to the file are not saved.No new version is created.



Implementation -
---------------

The program first initializes a structure which stores files present and their latest version using log file.
User is provided with list of existing file using log file.User is also allowed to create a new file.
Then the user is provided with menu where he can either choose to append or delete.Appending and deletion
operation is done on a temporary file.For deletion line no to be deleted is asked from the user.If 
user commits then a new version is created by renaming the temporary file. else if user undo's changes then
the temporary file is deleted.
