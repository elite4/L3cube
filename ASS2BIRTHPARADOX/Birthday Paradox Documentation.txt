		 BIRTHDAY PARADOX 
		

Problem Statement:-
Write a code that verifies- birthday paradox is indeed correct.


Program Description -

It is a program that mathematically calculates the probablity of two people having the same birthday among 'n' different people.

It then verifies this calculated probablity by actually carrying out trials and checks whether the mathematical probablity and actual probablity matches.  
			

Implementation -
----------------

Language Used - C++

The code is divided into 3 modules:
1) Calculating the probability for 'n' number of people.  n is input from user.
   
	Explaination: Finds out mathematical probablity using exponential functions.
		
2) Calculating the probability for the number of people varrying from 1 to 23.

	Explaination: Finds out mathematical probablity considering each event as an independant event.

3) Verifying the calculated probablity by actually generating random birthdates and checking for a common birthdate.
