with same content, different names, different paths)in a given
hard drive and allows the user to delete or ignore them.

How to use( in Linux):

Place the  filedup.c file in folder where you want to searchduplicate
files. On  executing,  all the duplicate files (with their path) are
listed. An option to delete is provided to the user. If user chooses

----------------

Language Used - C and system command in Linux

First we use a system command which lists all the files in the folder as 
well as sub folder sorted according to its size in bytes.Instead of system 
command we can also make use of dirent to list all files, get thier size 
using stat and sort them according to size. We are comparing to files at 
time. Firstly  we compare files for size,file having same size are compared
for extension and finaly files with same extension are compared Byte wise
to see if their content are same. This program finds duplicate files of any
file format.
